# Web Scrapping

Web Scrapping is the process of extracting data from websites without the use of their APIs.
It can be done in various other scripting languages aswell. But here I have implemented it in Python. 
I have scrapped the homepage of TIOBE Index website. I extracted the table of Top 20 programming languages and stored it in a csv file (tiobe.csv). 

# Note
In this case we didnot require any data cleaning, but in some cases we may require to use other functions which help in removing unwanted phrases or characters from our data.
